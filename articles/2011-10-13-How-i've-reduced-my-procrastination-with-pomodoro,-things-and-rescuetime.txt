title: How I've reduced my procrastination with pomodoro, things and rescuetime
date: October 13, 2011

Sometimes i have a hard time with distraction, i've found the most efficient solution for me so far is the pomodoro technique. The workflow is very simple, I have a list with all the tasks for today, I simply choose one task:

1. Work for 25 minutes on the task.
2. Take a break for 5 minutes.
3. Repeat.

If I'm done with the task I pick a new one.

## How I collect and organize my tasks

I Use [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/) to collect tasks. I have it installed on both my Mac and iPhone, so if I'm on the run I can still type it in.

## How i start a pomodoro

I use this nifty little app [pomodoro](http://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/pomodoro/id417574133?mt=12). When you start a pomodoro it can see all the tasks from today through things, but the best part is that you can script it. When it starts a pomodoro this little applescript is fired off:

    :::ruby
    tell application "RescueTime"
      activate
    end tell

    tell application "System Events"
      tell process "RescueTime"
        click menu bar item "RescueTime" of menu bar 1
        key code 125
        key code 125
        key code 36
        key code 36
      end tell
    end tell

This activates [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) which blocks distracting sites like news.ycombinator, reddit, facebook etc.
