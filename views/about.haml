    %h1 About me

  .padding
    %p I love optimizing business processes and programming. Often I combine the two. My weapon of choice is Ruby on Rails combined with jQuery. It allows me to come from start to finish freakishly fast. I've been programming with Ruby and Ruby on Rails for 4 years, and making websites in 6 years.
    %strong Some of the things I have experience with:
    %ul
      %li Creating custom solutions from start to finish.
      %li Integrating with a payment gateway.
      %li Google maps integrations.
      %li SEO optimization.
    %p When I don't program, I enjoy running and playing the guitar. Should you ever be in Aarhus, Denmark, you are more than welcome to contact me for a running or jam session. :)
